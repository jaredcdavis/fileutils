Fileutils Tests
===============

Fileutils has (or rather, will eventually have) a fairly elaborate
test suite.


## Unix, Linux, BSD, Darwin

For Unix-like operating systems, you can run the tests by going into
the `unix` directory and then running

```
make LISP=sbcl
```

Or similar, replacing `sbcl` with the command to execute your Lisp.

The test suite requires `perl` and common commands.


## Windows

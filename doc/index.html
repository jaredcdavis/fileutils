<h1>Fileutils Library</h1>

<p>Fileutils is a library of file-system related functions for Common Lisp.  It
is meant to be portable across Unix-like and Windows file systems and across
Lisp implementations.</p>

<p>Fileutils avoids the Common Lisp <i>pathname</i> functionality (which
differs across Lisp implementations), and instead provides an API where paths
are represented as ordinary strings.  Users of fileutils should not need to
know anything about Common Lisp's pathnames.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Note: Installation instructions are not covered here.  Instead, see
BOZO.</p>


<h2><a name="definitions">Definitions</a></h2>

<h5><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h5>

<p>Many Fileutils can optionally accept a <b>config</b> argument that governs
their behavior.  For instance, the <tt>absolute-path-p</tt> function can be
configured to act like a Unix system or a Windows system.</p>

<p>By default all such Fileutils functions read their configuration from
<b>fileutils:*default-config*</b>, which is automatically initialized when
fileutils is loaded as is appropriate for the host.</p>

<p>BOZO describe configuration objects and what can be controlled.</p>


<h5><a name="vanillapath">Vanilla Path</a></h5>

<p>Many Fileutils functions accept <b>vanilla path</b> arguments.  A vanilla
path is an ordinary Common Lisp strings that should generally indicate a single
file or directory.</p>

<p>Characters like <b>*</b> and <b>?</b>, which are given special
interpretation in many shells, have no special meaning in vanilla paths.  That
is, a vanilla path such as <tt>"foo/*.txt"</tt> does <b>not</b> refer to all of
the files in <tt>foo/</tt> that end with <tt>.txt</tt>; instead, it refers to a
single file whose name might have to be written using quotes
like <tt>'foo/*.txt'</tt> to avoid wildcard expansion in most shells.</p>

<p>The <b>~</b> character, which expands to user home directories on most
shells, also has no special meaning in a vanilla path.  That is, a vanilla path
such as <tt>"~jared/foo.txt"</tt> does not refer to <tt>foo.txt</tt> in my home
directory, but instead referse to a single file whose name might be written at
the terminal as <tt>'./~jared/foo.txt'</tt>.</p>



<h2><a name="pathname">Path Name Functions</a></h2>

<h5><a name="absolute-path-p">(absolute-path-p path [:config config]) &rarr; bool</a></h5>
<ul>
<li><tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a></li>
<li><tt>config</tt> is a <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> which
defaults to <b>fileutils:*default-config*</b></li>
</ul>

<p>We check whether <tt>path</tt> is an absolute path, returning the answer
as <tt>t</tt> or <tt>nil</tt>.  On Unix-like systems this essentially just
means the path starts with a <tt>/</tt> character.  On Windows it means the
path begins with a drive letter like <tt>c:\</tt> or a share name
like <tt>\\mediabox\movies</tt>.  See
also <a href="#relative-path-p">relative-path-p</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="relative-path-p">(relative-path-p path [:config config]) &rarr; bool</a></h5>
<ul>
<li><tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a></li>
<li><tt>config</tt> is a <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> which
defaults to <b>fileutils:*default-config*</b></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just the opposite
of <a href="#absolute-path-p">absolute-path-p</a>.</p>

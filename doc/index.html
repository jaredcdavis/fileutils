<h1>Fileutils Library Documentation</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jaredcdavis/fileutils">Fileutils</a> is
a small library of file-system related functions for Common Lisp.  It
is meant to be portable across Unix-like and Windows file systems and
across Lisp implementations.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Most Common Lisp functions that deal with files&mdash;for instance
<a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_open.htm">open</a> or
<a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_cmp_fi.htm">compile-file</a>&mdash;use
<a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/26_glo_p.htm#pathname_designator">pathname
designators</a> that indicate the desired file.</p>

<p>When you call these functions on a string such
as <tt>"main.c"</tt>, the string is converted into
a <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/26_glo_p.htm#pathname">pathname
object</a>, which is a structure with a <i>host</i>, <i>device</i>,
<i>directory</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>type</i>, and <i>version</i>.  This
conversion is normally done by the Common
Lisp <a href="http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/f_pn.htm">pathname</a>
function.  In other cases, pathnames are created by explicitly calling
functions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>SBCL's <a href="http://sbcl.org/manual/index.html#Native-Filenames">parse-native-namestring</a>, or</li>
<li>CCL's
<a href='http://ccl.clozure.com/ccl-documentation.html#f_native-translated-namestring'>ccl:native-translated-namestring</a>, or</li>
<li>CMUCL's
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cmucl/doc/cmu-user/extensions.html#FN:unix-namestring">ext:unix-namestring</a>, or</li>
<li>or for CLISP or Allegro or Lispworks or ...</li>
</ul>

<p>These approaches are all generally similar but have Lisp-specific
behaviors.  Even Lisps on the same operating system may not agree how
characters like <tt>~</tt>, <tt>:</tt>, <tt>*</tt> are to be handled.
These differences can lead to portability problems when manipulating
paths or sending paths to external programs.</p>

</a>
</div>

<div class="content">

<p>To avoid these differences, Fileutils provides functions for
working with <a name="vanillapath"><b>vanilla paths</b></a>.  A
vanilla path is an ordinary Common Lisp string that indicates a single
file or directory.  We use the word <i>vanilla</i> to emphasize that
these are a very basic kind of path, lacking the bells and whistles
that are found in shell environments.  For instance,</p>

<ul class="long">

<li>Characters like <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> have no special meaning.  A
vanilla path like <tt class="vpath">"foo/*.txt"</tt> does not refer to
all of the files in <tt>foo/</tt> that end with <tt>.txt</tt>.
Instead, it refers to a single file whose name might have to be
written using quotes like <tt>'foo/*.txt'</tt> to avoid wildcard
expansion in most shells.</li>

<li>Similarly, the <b>~</b> character, which expands to user home
directories on most shells, also has no special meaning in a vanilla
path.  A vanilla path like <tt class="vpath">"~jared/foo.txt"</tt>
does not refer to <tt>foo.txt</tt> in Jared's home directory.
Instead, it refers to a single file whose name might usually have to
be written at the terminal as <tt>'./~jared/foo.txt'</tt> to avoid ~
expansion by the shell.</li>

<li>Similarly the <b>$</b> character has no special meaning in a
vanilla path.  It does not, for instance, allow you to refer to
environment variables.</li>

</ul>

<p>The interpretation of vanilla paths in Fileutils is (of course)
operating-system specific&mdash;a path on a Unix-like system might
look like <tt class="vpath">"/usr/bin"</tt>, and on a Windows system
may look like
<tt class="vpath">"C:\autoexec.bat"</tt>.  However, unlike Common Lisp
path specifiers, the interpretation is meant to be fixed across all
Lisps on the same platform.</p>

<p>Fileutils provides some basic <a href="#functions">functions</a>
for working with vanilla paths.  We also
provide <a href="#path-to-lisp">path-to-lisp</a>, which can convert a
vanilla path into a pathname object for use in Common Lisp functions
like <tt>open</tt>.</p>

<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>

<p><span class="bozo">BOZO Fileutils is not yet distributed with
Quicklisp.  For now you have to get it manually.  See the
<a href="https://github.com/jaredcdavis/fileutils/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation
instructions</a> for details.</p>

<p>Once you have Fileutils installed, all of its
functions are found in the <b>fileutils</b> package.</p>

<div class="examples">
<p>Example (CCL on Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  jared@k3 ~ $ <b>ccl</b>

<h2><a name="Functions">API Reference</a></h2>
<div id="nav"></div>

<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="path-kinds">+path-kinds+</a></h5>

<p>This constant gives the possible return values
from <a href="#path-type">path-type</a>.</p>

<pre>
  (nil                       ;; nil means "does not exist"
   :regular-file
   :directory
   :symbolic-link
   :broken-symbolic-link
   :pipe
   :socket
   :character-device
   :block-device)
</pre>


</div>



<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="absolute-path-p">(absolute-path-p path) &rarr; bool</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We check
whether it is an absolute path, returning the answer as <tt>t</tt>
or <tt>nil</tt>.</p>

<p>On Unix-like systems this essentially just means the path starts
with a <tt>/</tt> character.  On Windows it means the path begins with
a drive letter like <tt>c:\</tt> or a share name
like <tt>\\mediabox\movies</tt>.  See
also <a href="#relative-path-p">relative-path-p</a>.</p>

<div class="examples">
<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  (absolute-path-p "/usr/bin/banana") ;; t
  (absolute-path-p "books")           ;; nil
</pre>

<p>Examples (Windows systems):</p>
<pre>
  (absolute-path-p "c:\\windows") ;; t
  (absolute-path-p "books")       ;; nil
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is entirely a string-based check that does not consult the file system,
network, etc.  Accordingly, whether a path is absolute or relative says nothing
about whether it exists, can be read or written, etc.</p>
</div>



<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="catfile">(catfile path file) &rarr; new-path</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  The
<tt>file</tt> is a new component to add to the path.  We create a new
vanilla path, essentially <i>path/file</i>.</p>

<p>This is basically just string concatenation except that we add a
directory separator to <tt>path</tt> when necessary.</p>

<div class="examples">

<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  (catfile "/home/jared"  ".bashrc")  ;; "/home/jared/.bashrc"
  (catfile "/home/jared/" ".bashrc")  ;; "/home/jared/.bashrc"
</pre>
</div>

<p>Corner cases.  What if path is empty?  What if file has multiple
parts?</p>

</div>


<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="clean-path">(clean-path path) &rarr; new-path</h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We
construct a new vanilla path, which is logically equivalent to the
input path, but may have redundant components removed.</p>

<div class="examples">

<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  (clean-path "///foo//bar")    ;; "/foo/bar"
  (clean-path "foo/bar/")       ;; "foo/bar"
  (clean-path "foo/./bar")      ;; "foo/bar"
</pre>
</div>

<p>Corner case.  On Unix-like systems, <tt>clean-path</tt> does
<b>not</b> clean up <tt>..</tt>'s in paths.  For instance, it will not
simplify <tt>"foo/../bar"</tt> into just <tt>bar</tt>.  This is
because, in certain cases involving symlinks, doing so could change
the meaning of the path.</p>

<p>This is entirely a string-based path cleanup that does not consult
the file system, network, etc.  Accordingly, just because a path has
been cleaned up does not mean that it exists, can be read or written,
etc.</p>

<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="path-exists-p">(path-exists-p path) &rarr; bool</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We check
whether <tt>path</tt> exists on the current file system.  See
also <a href="#path-type">path-type</a>.</p>

<div class="examples">
<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  (path-exists-p "/usr/bin/")        ;; probably t
  (path-exists-p "newt-recipes.txt") ;; probably nil
</pre>

<p>Examples (Windows systems):</p>
<pre>
  (path-exists-p "c:\\windows")                ;; probably t
  (path-exists-p "books\\snake-wrangling.pdf") ;; probably nil
</pre>
</div>

<p>Whether a path exists says nothing about what kind of path it is.  For
instance, on a Unix-like system, <tt>path-exists-p</tt> will return true for
ordinary files, directories, special devices like <tt>"/dev/null"</tt>, and
esoteric files like sockets and pipes.  Moreover, we say that symbolic links
exist even when they are broken.</p>


</div>

<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="path-to-lisp">(path-to-lisp path) &rarr; lisp-pathname</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We create,
from <tt>path</tt>, a corresponding Common Lisp
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Body/19_b.htm">pathname object</a>.</p>


<p>The <tt>pathname</tt> object that is created by <tt>path-to-lisp</tt> can
then given to functions like <tt>open</tt>.</p>
</div>



<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="path-type">(path-type path [:follow-symlinks bool]) &rarr; kind</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We
determine what kind of path it is and return a symbol.  The possible return
values are listed in the constant <a href="#path-kinds">+path-kinds+</a>.</p>


<div class="examples">
<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>
<pre>
  (path-type "/bin/ls")         ;; :regular-file
  (path-type "/usr/local/bin")  ;; :directory
  (path-type "/does/not/exist") ;; nil
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can configure how symbolic links are handled.  By default,
<tt>:follow-symlinks</tt> is <tt>t</tt> and we try to treat symbolic
links transparently.  That is, we follow any valid symbolic links and
return the type of the link's destination.  If you instead set
<tt>:follow-symlinks</tt> to <tt>nil</tt>, then the type of a symbolic
link will be reported as <tt>:symbolic-link</tt>.</p>

<div class="examples">
<p>Examples (supposing <tt>my-ls</tt> is a symlink to <tt>/bin/ls</tt>):</p>
<pre>
  (path-type "my-ls")                        ;; :regular-file
  (path-type "my-ls" :follow-symlinks nil)   ;; :symbolic-link
</pre>
</div>

<p class="bozo">BOZO what about :broken-symbolic-link?  We need a good test
suite to establish the correct behavior here.</p>

<p class="bozo">BOZO what about circular symbolic links?</p>


</div>



<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="relative-path-p">(relative-path-p path) &rarr; bool</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We check
whether it is an absolute path, returning the answer as <tt>t</tt>
or <tt>nil</tt>.</p>

<div class="examples">
<p>Examples (Unix-like systems):</p>

<pre>
  (relative-path-p "/usr/local/bin")  ;; nil
  (relative-path-p "books/spec.pdf")  ;; t
</pre>

<p>Examples (Windows systems):</p>

<pre>
  (relative-path-p "c:\\windows")  ;; nil
  (relative-path-p "games\\quake") ;; t
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is just the opposite
of <a href="#absolute-path-p">absolute-path-p</a>; see its description
for more details.</p>
</div>




<div class="fn">
<h5><a name="split-path">(split-path path) &rarr; volume, dir, file</a></h5>

<p>The <tt>path</tt> is a <a href="#vanillapath">vanilla path</a>.  We
split it up into three
components&mdash;<tt>volume</tt>, <tt>directory</tt>,
and <tt>file</tt>, each of which are always strings.</p>

<p>BOZO document me.</p>
